# Test Results for Elasticsearch Integration

## Summary
The tests confirm that the application is working correctly for the core functionality of indexing documents in Elasticsearch using the direct Elasticsearch client. The previous BadRequestError issue has been resolved by updating the Elasticsearch client configuration to be compatible with Elasticsearch 8.5.3.

## Changes Made
1. Updated the Elasticsearch client version in `requirements.txt` from 9.0.2 to 8.5.3 to match the Elasticsearch server version (8.5.3) specified in the Docker configuration.
2. Updated the `create_elasticsearch_client` function in `elasticsearch_utils.py` to use `verify_certs=False` for Elasticsearch 8.x compatibility.
3. Updated the `ensure_index_exists` function in `elasticsearch_utils.py` to use `ignore=400` when creating an index for Elasticsearch 8.x compatibility.
4. Updated the format of bulk indexing actions in the `index_documents` function in `elasticsearch_utils.py` for Elasticsearch 8.x compatibility.
5. Updated error handling for failed documents in the `index_documents` function in `elasticsearch_utils.py` for Elasticsearch 8.x compatibility.

## Test Results

### Direct Elasticsearch Client Test
The simple test script (`simple_test.py`) that tests only the direct Elasticsearch client functionality shows:
- Successfully connected to Elasticsearch
- Successfully processed 4 files from the data directory
- Successfully indexed 4 documents in Elasticsearch
- Successfully verified that the documents were indexed in the Elasticsearch index

**Result: PASSED**

### Full Application Test
The full application test script (`test_application.py`) shows:
- Successfully connected to Elasticsearch
- Successfully processed files from the data directory
- Successfully indexed documents in Elasticsearch using the direct client
- The Spark-to-Elasticsearch connection fails with an error: `Connection error (check network and/or proxy settings)- all nodes failed; tried [[172.22.0.2:9200]]`

**Result: PARTIALLY PASSED**

## Known Issues
There is an issue with the Spark-to-Elasticsearch connection. Spark is trying to connect to Elasticsearch at `172.22.0.2:9200` (which is the Docker container's internal IP) instead of `localhost:9200` (which is what the Python client uses). This is causing a connection timeout error when Spark tries to write the DataFrame to Elasticsearch.

This issue is not critical for the core functionality of the application, as documents are still successfully indexed using the direct Elasticsearch client. However, it should be addressed in the future to enable the Spark-to-Elasticsearch integration.

## Conclusion
The application is now working correctly for the core functionality of indexing documents in Elasticsearch. The BadRequestError issue has been resolved by ensuring compatibility between the Elasticsearch client and server versions.
